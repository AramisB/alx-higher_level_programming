JavaScript for Beginners: A Quick Start Guide
This guide provides a foundation for learning JavaScript, a versatile and powerful programming language used for web development, mobile app development, and more.

Why JavaScript?

Versatile: Works on the front-end (web pages), back-end (server-side logic), and even mobile apps.
Relatively Easy to Learn: Clear syntax and beginner-friendly features make it a great starting point.
High Demand: JavaScript developers are highly sought-after.
Large and Active Community: Ample resources, tutorials, and support are available online.
Constant Evolution: New features and standards keep the language fresh and engaging.

Running JavaScript:

In-browser Console: Access through developer tools (F12) for quick testing.
HTML Script Tag: Embed code within <script> tags in your HTML.

External JavaScript File: Create separate .js files and link them to HTML using <script src="script.js"></script>.

Creating Variables and Constants:

Variables: Use let or const with a name. Values can change (let) or remain constant (const).
e.g
let age = 25; // Variable
const PI = 3.14159; // Constant

Data Types:

Primitive: Numbers, strings, booleans, undefined, null, symbol (rarely used).
Complex: Objects (key-value pairs) and arrays (ordered lists).

Control Flow Statements:

if: Executes code if a condition is true.
if...else: Executes code based on a condition.

Comments:
Use // for single lines or /* */ for multi-line comments to explain code or disable parts temporarily.

Assigning Values:
Use the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to a variable.

Loops:

while: Repeatedly executes code as long as a condition is true.
for: Concise way to iterate over a sequence of values.

break and continue:

break: Exits a loop prematurely.
continue: Skips the current iteration of the loop.

Functions:

Reusable blocks of code that perform tasks. Can take parameters (inputs) and return values (outputs).


Scope of Variables:

Global Scope: Accessible throughout the program (use with caution).
Function Scope: Only accessible within the function it's declared in.

Arithmetic Operators:

+, -, *, /, % (modulo), ** (exponentiation).

Manipulating Objects:

Collections of key-value pairs to store data. Access properties using dot notation (.) or bracket notation ([]).

Importing Files (Node.js):

Use require() to import modules from other JavaScript files.
