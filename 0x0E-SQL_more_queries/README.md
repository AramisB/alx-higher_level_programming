MySQL User Management and Fundamentals
This guide provides an introduction to managing users, permissions, and exploring fundamental SQL concepts in MySQL.

User Creation and Permissions:

Creating a User:
Log in to MySQL as the root user (mysql -u root -p).
Use CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; to create a user.
Replace username with your desired username.
Replace host with the hostname or IP address allowed for access (e.g., 'localhost' for local access).
Replace password with a strong password.

Granting Permissions:
Use GRANT privilege_type ON database_name.table_name TO 'username'@'host'; to grant access.
Replace privilege_type with specific actions like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.
Replace database_name with the specific database.
Replace table_name with the specific table (optional, if granting access to a specific table).

Additional MySQL Concepts:

Constraints: Enforce data integrity:
PRIMARY KEY: Unique identifier for each row.
FOREIGN KEY: Creates links between tables.
NOT NULL: Prevents null values in a column.
UNIQUE: Ensures no duplicate values (except nulls).
Subqueries: Nested queries for data retrieval based on additional criteria.
Joins: Combine data from multiple tables:
INNER JOIN: Matching rows in both tables.
LEFT JOIN: Includes all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN: Includes all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
FULL JOIN: Includes all rows from both tables.
UNION and MINUS: Combine results from multiple queries.
UNION: Returns distinct rows from both queries.
MINUS: Returns rows present in the first query but not in the second.
